//permissions pushing to git from command line
1. I was logged into git as bookoflife when I logged in and was able to push master
2. I was logged in as mike.vokes.dev when i created the repo so this doesn't matter
3. I deleted the keys from both and created new ones, couldn't push after the bookoflife new keys
4. New mike.vokes.dev key in terminal, following the git procedures and then copying into the github key settings
5. Able to push master to repo in mike.vokes.dev github repo
6. git config --list => shows bookoflife username and admin@ for email - so not relevant
7. Bottom left of VSC shows on master branch
8. Lecture 80 of Docker (Sgrider) show new repo creation
9. then Travis CI integration - GitHub monitors it 
10. Travis will be used to TEST the code
11. travis-ci.org - sign in with GitHub
12. Should see all GitHub repos - activation ones, tabbed green active

//new branches
1. git checkout -b CSS
